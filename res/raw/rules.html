            Don't End a Word is simple. Take turns adding fixedLetters and try to force your opponent to make a word!
            Challenge when you think your opponent has created a word, or sequence that isn't part of any word. You win
            if you are right. Make sure that you have a word in mind every time you add a letter, and try to make your
            opponent be the one who adds the last letter!

            Start a game by either choosing a friend or random opponent to play with. After your invitation is accepted
            the game will appear in your "My Games" screen. The game will provide one random letter. Take turns
            adding one letter to the front or back of the sequence. Issue a challenge when the other player has created
            a word or you can't think of a word containing that sequence. If you are challenged you will be asked to
            show the word you were thinking of. You'll win if the word is in the game dictionary and contains the
            sequence. If you can't think of a word, or the only word you can think of needs just one letter to complete
            it, play or challenge anyway. If you don't make a move in 2 days you'll time out and lose. Valid words must
            be between 4 and 30 fixedLetters long. When you finish a game and want to play again, touch the rematch button.
            Good luck!</p>
